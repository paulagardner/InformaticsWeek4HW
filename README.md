Answers to questions:
1. How do you delete all output from a snakemake work flow?
    * from documentation: command line interface section: snakemake --delete-all-output
2. How do you delete output from a single snakemake rule?
    * not sure, but perhaps you could make the output section of each particular rule output: temp("file"), and if it isn't called in another rule it should be deleted automatically
3. What is the citation for snakemake?
    * Köster, Johannes and Rahmann, Sven. “Snakemake - A scalable bioinformatics workflow engine”. Bioinformatics 2012.
